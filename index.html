                        Welcome to my website! My name is Griffin Edwards, and I primarily use he/him pronouns.
                        I am a first year Ph.D. student in  the Georgia Institute of Technology School of Mathematics. 
                        My current intersts are in arithmetic geometry. I completed my undergraduate degree at Brown University. 
                        This website is still a work in progress, so please forgive its current messy nature.

                                Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, 
                                    irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

                                Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently 
                                    by various communities to serve their needs.
